Getting Started
This repository is designed for developers looking to practice and understand DSA concepts through hands-on coding in JavaScript and PHP.
Prerequisites

Node.js (for running JavaScript code)
PHP (version 7.4 or higher)
A code editor (e.g., VS Code)
Git (for cloning the repository)

Installation

Clone the repository:git clone [https://github.com/your-username/dsa-practice-code.git](https://github.com/LAVESH-D-KUMBHALKAR/DSA-CODE.git)


Navigate to the project directory:cd **DSA-CODE**


**For JavaScript:**
Install Node.js if not already installed.
Run JavaScript files using:node javascript/<filename>.js




**For PHP:**
Ensure PHP is installed.
Run PHP files using:php php/<filename>.php

javascript/: Contains DSA implementations in JavaScript.
php/: Contains DSA implementations in PHP.
Each subdirectory (e.g., arrays, linked_lists, trees) contains specific algorithm or data structure implementations.

Usage

Navigate to the desired folder (javascript/ or php/).
Run individual files to test specific DSA implementations.
Example:
JavaScript: node javascript/arrays/twoSum.js
PHP: php php/arrays/twoSum.php


Each file includes comments explaining the logic and approach for the given problem.
